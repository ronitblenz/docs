# Introduction

## Chapter Summary

The emergence of cloud computing has transformed the way applications are developed, deployed, and designed. Cloud services offer a range of resources like virtual servers, networking capabilities, storage options, and databases, all available on-demand. These services are user-friendly and can be managed interactively or through application programming interfaces (APIs).

This chapter focuses on the concept of Cloud Native Architecture, a modern approach to application architecture that is intrinsically linked with cloud technologies. We'll explore the defining features of cloud-native applications and how they stand apart from traditional software design methods.

## Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of:

- The defining traits of Cloud Native Architecture: Gain insights into the unique characteristics that distinguish cloud-native applications from conventional ones.
- The advantages of autoscaling and serverless models: Understand how these patterns contribute to efficiency, scalability, and resource optimization in cloud environments.
- The role of open standards and community involvement: Learn about the significance of open standards and collaborative projects in fostering innovation and interoperability in cloud-native ecosystems.
