# Chapter Overview: Cloud Native Observability

In the dynamic environment of cloud-native computing, where applications are developed to run in the cloud from the outset, the complexity of monitoring and managing these applications increases significantly. This chapter demystifies the concept of cloud-native observability, an essential discipline that goes beyond traditional monitoring to provide deeper insights into the behavior of applications and infrastructure in the cloud.

## Key Learning Objectives

### Understanding the Importance of Observability

- **Observability vs. Monitoring:** While monitoring provides insights into what's happening within your systems, observability offers a more nuanced view, allowing you to understand why things happen, making it crucial for cloud-native applications.
- **Goal:** Grasp why observability is fundamental to successfully managing applications in a cloud-native ecosystem.

### Metrics, Logs, and Traces

- **Metrics:** Numeric data representing various aspects of a system at a point in time. Useful for understanding the overall health and performance.
- **Logs:** Immutable, time-stamped records of events that happen in your system. Essential for debugging and understanding historical activity.
- **Traces:** Representations of a series of causally related distributed events that encode the end-to-end request flow through a distributed system.
- **Goal:** Comprehend how metrics, logs, and traces are pivotal for achieving comprehensive observability.

### Containerized Application Logging

- **Challenges:** With containerized applications, traditional logging practices need to be adapted to cater to dynamic environments where containers are ephemeral.
- **Goal:** Learn how to effectively capture and analyze logs from containers to troubleshoot issues and gain operational insights.

### Prometheus for Metric Collection

- **Prometheus:** An open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability, frequently used in cloud-native setups.
- **Goal:** Understand how Prometheus can be employed to collect, store, and query metrics from cloud-native applications, facilitating real-time monitoring and alerting.

### Optimizing Cloud Costs

- **Efficiency and Cost-Management:** Observability tools can help identify underutilized resources, inefficiencies, and potential optimizations, leading to significant cost savings.
- **Goal:** Recognize the role of observability in optimizing cloud resource usage and managing expenses effectively.
