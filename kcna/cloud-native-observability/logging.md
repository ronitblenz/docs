# Logging

Logging is a fundamental aspect of developing, monitoring, and troubleshooting applications. In cloud-native ecosystems, where applications are often distributed across multiple containers and nodes, effective logging strategies are crucial for maintaining visibility into application behavior and system performance. This guide simplifies the concept of logging, highlighting practices for cloud-native environments.

## Basics of Logging

Logging involves recording events and data points generated by applications and systems. These logs provide insights into application performance, errors, and operational activities. In modern application frameworks and languages, logging capabilities are extensive and easily configurable.

## Standard I/O Streams in Unix/Linux

- **standard input (stdin):** Receives input for a program.
- **standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr):** Used for outputting logs and errors, facilitating the capture of logs from containerized processes.

## Viewing Container Logs

Container orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes provide built-in commands to access logs that are directed to stdout and stderr.

### Docker Example

```bash
docker logs nginx
```

### Kubernetes Example

```bash
kubectl logs nginx
```

These commands allow developers and operators to quickly access and monitor the logs of running containers.

## Strategies for Managing Logs

In distributed systems, managing logs requires collecting them into a centralized location for analysis. There are several approaches:

### 1. **Node-level Logging**

- **Description:** Logs are collected at the node level by a logging agent and shipped to a centralized store.
- **Tools:** Fluentd, Filebeat.

### 2. **Logging via Sidecar Container**

- **Description:** A sidecar container within the Pod is responsible for collecting and shipping logs.
- **Advantage:** Simplifies log collection in containerized environments.

### 3. **Application-level Logging**

- **Description:** Applications are configured to send logs directly to a log store.
- **Consideration:** Requires application-level configuration, which may not be scalable across multiple applications.

## Storing and Analyzing Logs

Choosing the right storage and analysis tool is crucial for maximizing the value of log data.

- **Popular Tools:** OpenSearch, Grafana Loki.
- **Best Practice:** Use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to make logs more searchable and analyzable.

## Importance of Structured Logging

Structured logging, as opposed to plaintext logging, organizes log data into a consistent format, making it easier to query and analyze logs, especially in systems generating vast volumes of log data.
