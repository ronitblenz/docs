# Interacting with Kubernetes

Kubernetes, with its vast ecosystem, offers various ways to interact with your cluster. The most direct method is through the Kubernetes API, accessible via the `kubectl` command-line interface (CLI), graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and more advanced tools like Helm. Let's dive into the basics of interacting with Kubernetes, focusing on `kubectl` commands and other interaction tools.

## Using `kubectl`

`kubectl` is the official CLI tool for managing Kubernetes clusters. It provides a powerful way to perform nearly all operations required to manage workloads, from creating objects to monitoring their status and logs.

### Getting Started with `kubectl`

Before you can use `kubectl`, you'll need to install it. Installation instructions can be found in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

### Basic `kubectl` Commands

- **Listing Available Objects:**
  ```
  kubectl api-resources
  ```
  This command shows all the Kubernetes objects that can be managed via `kubectl`, including whether they're namespaced and their available API versions.

```
NAME                    SHORTNAMES  APIVERSION  NAMESPACED  KIND
...
configmaps              cm          v1          true        ConfigMap
...
namespaces              ns          v1          false       Namespace
nodes                   no          v1          false       Node
persistentvolumeclaims  pvc         v1          true        PersistentVolumeClaim
...
pods                    po          v1          true        Pod
...
services                svc         v1          true        Service

```

- **Understanding Kubernetes Objects:**
  ```
  kubectl explain <object>
  ```
  Use this command to get detailed documentation about any Kubernetes object, such as Pods, Deployments, or Services.

```
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is     
     created by clients and scheduled onto hosts. 

FIELDS: 
   apiVersion <string>     
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal         
     value, and may reject unrecognized values.
...
   kind <string>
...
   metadata <Object>
...
   spec <Object>
```

- **Creating Objects:**
  ```
  kubectl create -f <your-file>.yaml
  ```
  To create any Kubernetes object from a YAML file, this command comes in handy.

### Exploring `kubectl` Further

For a deeper dive into what `kubectl` can do:
```
kubectl --help
```
This command provides a comprehensive list of operations `kubectl` can perform, categorized by experience level from beginner to advanced.

```
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager. 

 Find more information at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/ 

Basic Commands (Beginner):
  create Create a resource from a file or from stdin
  expose Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes service
  run Run a particular image on the cluster
  set Set specific features on objects 

Basic Commands (Intermediate):
  explain Get documentation for a resource
  get Display one or many resources
  edit Edit a resource on the server
  delete Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector
```

## Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

For those who prefer a graphical interface over command-line tools, Kubernetes offers several options:

- [**Kubernetes Dashboard:**](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) The official web-based UI for Kubernetes.
- [**Lens:**](https://k8slens.dev/) A standalone application providing a rich interface to manage Kubernetes clusters.
- [**K9s:**](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) Offers a terminal-based UI to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- [**VMware Tanzu Octant:**](https://github.com/vmware-archive/octant) Another popular GUI, providing detailed insights into Kubernetes components.

## Advanced Tooling: Helm

Helm is often described as the package manager for Kubernetes. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes clusters by using packages called Charts.

- [**Helm Charts:**](https://helm.sh/) Package Kubernetes resources into a single unit, making it easy to share and deploy applications.
- [**Artifact Hub:**](https://artifacthub.io/) A registry where you can find and share Helm charts for a wide range of applications and services.

Whether you're more comfortable with command-line interfaces, prefer graphical user interfaces, or need the advanced capabilities of tools like Helm, Kubernetes offers a variety of ways to interact with your cluster. Each method has its own set of advantages, catering to different preferences and use cases. Getting familiar with these tools will significantly enhance your ability to manage and operate Kubernetes clusters effectively.
