# Introduction

## Chapter Overview

With the rise of cloud computing, the requirements and possibilities for developing, deploying and designing applications have changed significantly.

Cloud providers offer a variety of on-demand services, starting with simple (virtual-) servers, networking, storage, databases, and much more. Deploying and managing these services is very convenient, either interactively, or by using application programming interfaces (APIs).

In this chapter, you will learn about the principles of modern application architecture, often referred to as Cloud Native Architecture. We will discover what makes these applications native to cloud systems and how they differ from traditional approaches.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Discuss the characteristics of Cloud Native Architecture
Explain the benefits of autoscaling and serverless patterns
Understand the importance of open standards and community projects in cloud native environments
