# Application Delivery Fundamentals

The journey from writing code to deploying an application involves several critical steps, all aimed at ensuring the application is reliable, scalable, and maintainable. Let's break down these fundamentals into simpler terms.

## Version Control with Git

- **The Role of Git:** Git, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, is a decentralized version control system that's become essential for managing source code. It allows developers to track changes, work on different features simultaneously via branches, and merge these changes without losing consistency.
- **Why It Matters:** Source code is the intellectual property and backbone of any application. Managing it effectively with Git or another version control system ensures integrity, collaboration, and a solid foundation for application development.

## Building the Application

- **What It Involves:** Transforming source code into a runnable form, often including the compilation of code, bundling of assets, and potentially the creation of a container image to be run on platforms like Kubernetes.
- **The Importance of Automation:** Automating the build process eliminates manual errors, speeds up delivery, and ensures every build is consistent and reproducible.

## Testing for Quality

- **Automated Testing:** After building, the application undergoes automated testing to verify functionality, performance, security, and other critical factors. This step is crucial for maintaining high-quality standards and ensuring changes do not introduce new issues.
- **Continuous Integration:** Often part of a CI/CD pipeline, this automated testing phase enables developers to merge code changes frequently and reliably, catching and addressing issues early in the development cycle.

## Delivering to the Platform

- **Deployment on Kubernetes:** For applications targeting Kubernetes, deployment involves writing Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to describe how the application should run, including configurations for pods, services, and other Kubernetes resources.
- **Container Registries:** Newly built container images are pushed to a container registry, from where Kubernetes can pull them to deploy the application across the cluster.

## [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)

- **The Concept:** IaC is a practice where infrastructure setup (servers, networks, volumes, etc.) is defined in code files, rather than set up manually. This approach leverages cloud APIs to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources.
- **Benefits for Developers:** By describing infrastructure in code, developers can take part in infrastructure management, apply version control to infrastructure changes, and ensure environment consistency across development, testing, and production.


From version control with Git through automated builds, testing, and deployment, to the adoption of Infrastructure as Code principles, the application delivery process embodies the DevOps culture of automation, collaboration, and rapid iteration. Understanding and implementing these fundamentals are essential for leveraging the full potential of modern cloud resources and delivering robust, scalable applications efficiently.
