# Introduction

## Chapter Summary

The emergence of cloud computing has transformed the way applications are developed, deployed, and designed. Cloud services offer a range of resources like virtual servers, networking capabilities, storage options, and databases, all available on-demand. These services are user-friendly and can be managed interactively or through application programming interfaces (APIs).

This chapter focuses on the concept of Cloud Native Architecture, a modern approach to application architecture that is intrinsically linked with cloud technologies. We'll explore the defining features of cloud-native applications and how they stand apart from traditional software design methods.
